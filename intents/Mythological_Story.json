            "Let us enjoy reading this Hindu Mythological Story of Feast of Kubera. \n\nKubera, god of wealth, had become arrogant. One day he decided to host an extravagant feast for the gods, such a feast as never had been hosted before. It would increase his prestige and show all men and gods the extent of his wealth and influence. \n\nAccordingly, he went to Mount Kailash to invite Lord Shiva. Shiva was his patron. Kubera owed all his wealth to Shiva who, pleased with his devotion had given him the boon that his wealth would never diminish, no matter how much he spent. \n\nShiva declined to come but said he would send his son, Ganesha. Kubera was disappointed. Shiva\u0027s presence would have been a feather in his cap. But at least he was sending Ganesha. It would have been a terrible snub if no one from the family were to come. Kubera resolved to make the feast so grand that Shiva\u0027s absence would not be felt. \n\nThe guests were many, thousands of them, both gods and men. They were accommodated in a huge hall built especially for the purpose. The chief guest, Ganesha, was the last to come. \n\nThe moment he entered, he began to ask for food. He was shown to a seat of honor and tantalizing dishes were set before him. He gulped them down and asked for more. He was given a second helping and then a third but his appetite remained undiminished. \n\nKubera ordered his army of cooks to produce more food but they could not keep pace with Ganesha\u0027s eating frenzy. The elephant-god was eating food meant for thousands. When he had finished all the food set before him, he began to shout, \"Give me more, give me more!\" and then getting impatiently to his feet, rushed to the enormous kitchen and devoured all the food there. \n\nKubera was aghast. All the food was gone and the guests had not been fed. Worse, Ganesha was still hungry. \n\n\"You call this a feast?\" Ganesha admonished Kubera. \"There\u0027s no food here. I\u0027m going home.\" \n\nKubera pleaded with him to stay, promising him more food in a little while but his young guest was in no mood to listen. He got on his mount and sped away. Kubera, fearing Shiva\u0027s wrath, followed in his own vehicle. When he arrived at Kailash, he found Ganesha complaining loudly to his father about the lack of food at his feast. \n\n\"What\u0027s this I hear, Kubera?\" asked Shiva, turning to the god. \"No food at your feast?\" \n\n\"I....I....,\" mumbled Kubera. \n\n\"Go in and ask your mother for some food,\" said Shiva to his son. \"I\u0027m sure Kubera did his best.\" \n\n\"I did, I did, my lord,\" said Kubera, feeling miserable. His feast had turned into a farce. Instead of adding to his prestige it had made him a laughing stock. But he was relieved to see that Shiva did not appear to be angry. \n\nHe fell at his patron\u0027s feet and begged forgiveness for his pride.\n\nSo there was your story!

            "Let us enjoy reading this Hindu Mythological Story of Solar Deities. \n\nRavana once went to challenge Surya, the Sun-God, to a fight. When he reached the Solar Region he saw that the sun was about to rise and sent an envoy to inform Surya of his arrival and the reason for his coming. \n\n\"Tell him,\" he instructed his envoy, \"that he should either stay and fight or accept defeat.\" \n\nSurya had begun his ascent into the sky when the envoy reached the gates of his palace. \n\nOne of the gatekeepers, Dandi, shouted out Ravana\u0027s message to his master. \n\nSurya shrugged and continued rising. \n\n\"Tell Ravana,\" he said, \"that I\u0027ve no time to spare.\" \n\nRavana went away shouting that he had defeated the Sun.\n\nSo there was your story!

            "Let us enjoy reading this Norse Mythological Story of Green Missile. \n\nBalder was the god of light in Norse mythology. He was the son of the chief god, Odin, and the goddess Frigg. \n\nBalder was loved by all except the wicked Loki, who, jealous of his popularity, plotted his death. \n\nBalder\u0027s mother had made all things—living and nonliving—swear an oath that they would never harm her son. So there was no weapon that could hurt him. \n\nNevertheless, Loki cast about for a way to destroy Balder. One day he learnt that there was one plant, the mistletoe that had not sworn the oath to Frigg. \n\nHe obtained a slender branch of the tree, sharpened one of its ends, and hastened to the great hall where the gods were feasting. They were entertaining themselves by good-naturedly flinging rocks and spears at Balder, knowing full well that nothing could harm him. \n\n\n Green Missile Loki stole up to the blind god Hoder who also happened to be Balder\u0027s brother and asked him why he was not hurling things at Balder like the others. \n\n\"I cannot see,\" said the god. \n\n\"Throw this,\" said Loki, thrusting the weapon he had made, into his hands. \"I\u0027ll guide you.\" \n\nHoder flung the sharpened branch. \n\nIt pierced Balder, and he fell down dead. \n\nLoki did not go unpunished. The gods chained him to rocks in a deep cavern. There, he awaits his release. For according to Norse mythology he will eventually break free and take his revenge on the deities who had attempted to bind him for eternity.\n\nSo there was your story! Want some more, then ask for it or say goodbye to end the conversation.",
            "Let us enjoy reading this Hindu Mythological Story of The Dowry. \n\nOne day Mahadev saw four men coming to his abode. \n\n\"They are my brothers,\" said his wife, Parvati. \"They\u0027ve come for dahej (bride price).\" \n\nMahadev welcomed his brothers-in-law and offered them food and drink, but when they began to talk of dowry he told them he had only two possessions—his khappar (a broken earthen pot) and his bull, Nandi. \n\n\"Take one of them,\" he said. \n\nThe brothers took Nandi. \n\nAs they were leaving, Parvati advised them to take good care of Nandi as the bull could make them wealthy. \n\n\"Take a look at his hump,\" she said. \n\nWhen the brothers returned they wondered how Nandi could make them rich. \n\n\"Perhaps there are jewels in his hump,\" said one of the brothers, \"else why should Parvati have drawn our attention to it.\" \n\nThey slew the animal and were greatly disappointed when it yielded no gems. \n\nParvati was furious. \n\n\"Oh, you foolish men!\" she said. \"When I drew attention to Nandi\u0027s hump I wanted to show you what a powerful body he had. If you had yoked him to a plough he would have helped you reap a rich harvest and made you prosperous. Now you will have to pay dearly for slaying a sacred animal!\" \n\nHaving vented her fury on them she left, saying she never wanted to see them again. \n\nBhils attribute their penury to the folly of these four men who were their ancestors. \n\nAn Agricultural People, one of our important tribes, the Bhil number nearly 2.5 million. They are based in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and parts of Maharashtra of India. Nearly all of them are engaged in agriculture.\n\nSo there was your story!

            "Let us enjoy reading this Greek Mythological Story of The Man Who Could not Die. \n\nEos, Goddess of Dawn fell in love with a youth named Tithonius, and the two spent many happy years together. But while Eos being a goddess retained her youth, Tithonius began to age. He asked his beloved to grant him immortality. She couldn’t do it on her own so she pleaded his case with Zeus, the supreme deity. \n\nZeus reluctantly granted the boon. \n\nThe story unfortunately does not have a happy ending. Tithonius had forgotten to ask for eternal youth. So though he could not die he could age. As his age advanced he became wrinkled and hunchbacked and revoltingly ugly. He pleaded with Eos to help him. \n\nShe could not take back the gift of immortality nor could she give him back his youth. But she could change his form. She turned him into a grasshopper.\n\nSo there was your story! Want some more, then ask for it or say goodbye to end the conversation."
