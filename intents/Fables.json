            "The title of the story is \"Ability of The Coward\"\n\n\nOnce, a coward lived in a village. Even the smallest sound would scare him. One day the royal messenger announced in the village \"The king has asked every young man of the kingdom to join the royal army. Itâ€™s an order. Everybody must follow it.\" \n\n\nThe coward was also forced to follow the royal order. So he too left for the city to join the royal army. \n\n\nOn the way the coward passed by a large and tall tree. Many crows were sitting on it and making a lot of noise. Loud noise of the crows scared the coward. He stopped due to fear. After standing for a few moments, he moved forward to go on but the crows again started to make a noise. Once again, the coward\u0027s mouth went dry with fear. He shivered in fright and in shaky voice he cried, \"Yes. Go on. Make as much noise as you want to. But I know you still cannot eat me up!\" \n\n\nThe coward was so scared that he thought the crows would eat him up. Actually he did not have the ability to join the royal army. A man must do only the task for which he is fit.\n\nSo there was your story! Want some more, then ask for it or say goodbye to end the conversation.",
            "The story is about the Advice of The Goat \n\n\nOnce, a villager owned a donkey and a goat. He used the donkey to carry loads of articles from the village to the city where he would roam around the whole day selling his articles. Sometime he could lend his donkey to others on hire when they needed it. As the donkey worked hard the whole day, the villager used to feed the donkey more food than he gave to the goat. \n\n\nThe goat felt jealous of the donkey. He advised the donkey, \"You work all day long and hardly get any rest. You must act that you are ill and fall down unconscious. This way, you\u00271l get rest for a few days.\" The donkey agreed to this and acted as if he was ill. The villager called the doctor. The doctor said, \u0027\u0027Your donkey has a strange illness. To cure him, you must feed him the soup made of a goat\u0027s lungs.\" \n\n\nThe villager at once killed the goat and cooked soup out of his lungs. Then he fed the soup to the donkey. \n\n\nThe goat had tried to harm the donkey out of jealousy but he had been killed for his evil nature.\n\nSo there was your story! Want some more, then ask for it or say goodbye to end the conversation.",
            "The title of the story is Blame.\n\n\nOne day a man went for a walk on the beach. He saw that a ship full of passengers struck a rock and capsized in the sea. The ship went under water and all the people on board fell into the sea. As they did not know how to swim, they drowned one by one. The man watched all this from the shore but could not do anything to help the people. \n\n\nIn the evening, he narrated the sad event of the ship\u0027s drowning to his friends. Everyone felt sorry for the dead people. The man said, \"God has not been just. To kill one sinner aboard the ship he killed so many other innocent people.\" \n\n\nAs he was saying this, he felt a pinch on his feet. He looked down. A red ant was biting his toe. Many other red ants were near his feet. In anger, he started stamping his feet to crush the red ants. \n\n\nGod appeared at the spot and said, \"See, how you are killing other innocent ants to kill the one which bit you. You were blaming me for my unjust act. Look at your own actions before blaming me for anything.\" \n\n\nThe man felt ashamed as he realized his mistake.\n\nSo there was your story! Want some more, then ask for it or say goodbye to end the conversation.",
